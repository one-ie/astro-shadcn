   - NotificationService, MetricsService, WebsiteService
   - Compose with existing services

3. **Generate Features from DSL** (Week 3)
   - Payment flows
   - Livestream management
   - Referral system
   - Notification system

4. **Build Frontend Components** (Week 4)
   - Payment UI
   - Livestream player
   - Referral dashboard
   - Analytics dashboard

### Maintenance:

- Review documentation monthly
- Sync on every ontology change
- Keep cross-references updated
- Archive deprecated docs

## Success Metrics

✅ **Consistency**: All docs reference same entity/connection/event types
✅ **Completeness**: 100% of Strategy.md features have ontology mappings
✅ **Clarity**: Each document has clear purpose and ownership
✅ **Currency**: All docs reflect latest architecture (2025-10-05)
✅ **Cross-reference**: All internal links valid
✅ **Coverage**: 46 entities, 33 connections, 54 events, 13 providers documented

---

## Conclusion

**All documentation is now synchronized and consistent.**

The ONE Platform documentation suite is:
- ✅ Complete (100% Strategy.md coverage)
- ✅ Consistent (all docs reference same ontology)
- ✅ Current (reflects latest architecture)
- ✅ Cross-referenced (all links valid)
- ✅ Clear (each doc has defined purpose)

**Ready for implementation!** 🚀

Every feature in Strategy.md can be built using our:
- 4-table ontology (46 entity types)
- DSL (Plain English + Technical)
- Service providers (13 external integrations)
- Effect.ts service layer (composable business logic)
- Convex backend (real-time data)

**No more architecture gaps. Time to build.**
